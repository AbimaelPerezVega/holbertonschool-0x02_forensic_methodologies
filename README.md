## 🕵️‍♂️ Case Studies  

### 🔍 **0. The Case of the Mysterious Image**  

**Objective:**  
- Use forensic analysis tools to uncover metadata and extract hidden information.  

**Steps:**  
1. Analyze image metadata using `exiftool`.  
2. Identify suspicious metadata entries that may contain the **owner's name**.  
3. Save the extracted name into `0-mystery.txt`.  

💾 **Example Submission:**  
```sh
$ cat 0-mystery.txt
John_Doe
🌍 1. Unraveling Location Clues from Image Metadata
Objective:

Extract GPS coordinates from image metadata and pinpoint the real-world location.
Steps:

Use exiftool to extract GPS coordinates from the image.
Enter the coordinates into Google Maps to locate the area.
Identify the street name and save it into 1-location.txt.

123 Example St, Forensics City
🚀 Features Implemented
✅ Metadata extraction using forensic tools.
✅ GPS coordinate tracking to pinpoint locations.
✅ Hands-on investigation tasks for cybersecurity training.

🔮 Future Enhancements
📌 Add more case studies with real-world forensic scenarios.
📌 Implement automated forensic scripts for metadata extraction.
📌 Develop an interactive web-based forensic analysis tool.

💡 Challenges Faced
🔸 Deciphering hidden metadata – Some files had deeply embedded information.
🔸 GPS tracking accuracy – Finding precise locations required external verification.
🔸 Handling different image formats – Some formats required extra tools to extract data.
